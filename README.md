# multi-client-server-in-python


In this project there is one server, that multi-clients connect with. The clients can perform some basic actions on the server: chatting with each other, manager commends: that can silent or kick a client. The server writes in a separate file for each client, where it store all the communication done by this client.

This project was done by me as a hobby.
